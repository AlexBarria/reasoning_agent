    This script is a test code to validate the results provided by the reasoning LLM.

    It calculates the total sugar content in a given volume of wine after adjusting for 
    instrument correction and evaporation loss. The script performs the following steps:
    1. Adjusts the sugar concentration based on the instrument correction.
    2. Adjusts the wine volume to account for evaporation loss.
    3. Calculates the total sugar content in grams.
    4. Rounds the result to two decimal places and prints the final output.

    The purpose of this script is to ensure the accuracy of calculations and validate 
    the reasoning provided by the LLM.
